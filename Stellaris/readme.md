## Mod Descriptions

Name | Purpose | Tested?
---- | ------- | -------
More Trait Picks | Increase total trait picks.  Add some racial traits. Make lithoids passive generation not suck. | Yes

## New Traits

Name | Purpose | ID | Notes
---- | ------- | -- | -----
Erik's Slave Race | Minutely add unity, to help focus which necroid slave species becomes neophytes. | erik_trait_traditional | Not sure if this works right, technically a cheat (something for free).
Arthropods | Make arthropods breed faster, but have lower lifespans. | erik_trait_arthropod | N/A
Bird People | Make birds better in space combat, but with a lower army health. | erik_trait_avian | N/A
Molluscoids | Molluscoids produce more alloys. | erik_trait_molluscoid | Would like to change this to make them passively produce alloys no matter the job.
Other Change 1 | Increase lithoid passive production from 0.01 to 0.05. | N/A | No new trait.

## Upcoming changes

1. Add reptile traits (can this be them getting more food from livestock?).
