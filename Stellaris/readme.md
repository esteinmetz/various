# Stellaris Mod(s)

## Description

This is a collection of mods.  All have been lightly tested, let me know what you think.

## Installation

Subscribe on Steam...otherwise download and install manually? <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2703916017>

Either way, load it last.  It includes patches and resources from other mods.

### Dependancies
Name | URL | Resources Used/Modified
---- | --- | -----------------------
Unique Ascension Perks | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1693982756 | Legendary Forge (used for origin, fixed district not adding buildings)

## Mod Descriptions

Name | Purpose | Tested?
---- | ------- | -------
More Trait Picks | Increase total trait picks.  Add some racial traits. Make lithoids passive generation not suck. | Mostly

## New Traits

Name | Purpose | ID | Notes
---- | ------- | -- | -----
Erik's Slave Race | Minutely add unity, to help focus which necroid slave species becomes neophytes. | erik_trait_traditional | Not sure if this works right, technically a cheat (something for free).
Arthropods | Make arthropods breed faster, but have lower lifespans. | erik_trait_arthropod | N/A
Bird People | Make birds better in space combat, but with a lower army health. | erik_trait_avian | N/A
Molluscoids | Molluscoids produce more alloys. | erik_trait_molluscoid | Would like to change this to make them passively produce alloys no matter the job.
Other Change 1 | Increase lithoid passive production from 0.01 to 0.05. | N/A | No new trait.

## New Origins
Name | Description | Notes
---- | ----------- | -----
Forge World | You begin on a Legendary Forge world. | This is great for minerals, alloys, ships, and robots.  Non-biological species only.

## Upcoming changes

1. Add reptile traits (can this be them getting more food from livestock?).
